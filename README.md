*(Remember to Link the **CSS** and **JS** into the **HTML**)*.

## Phase 1:
### Make a counter that continuously counts up to 10 when click of a button,and when the counter reaches 10 make the counter continuously count down.
## Phase 2:
### Take the API (*https://swapi.co/api/people/10/*) and collect 4 different objects from within that API and display it on the HTML.
## Phase 3:
### Take the fetch from the last phase and use that with a timeout (or replace phase 2 with this phase), and every 2 seconds it will update and display it on 4 HTML Elements. 
### (Optional: Make a CSS loader that loads the page within 5 seconds.)
